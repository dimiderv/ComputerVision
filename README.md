# Computer Vision, Image Processing and Analysis

Study of image processing algorithms (noise reduction, filtering, compression, improvement, edge detection), processing of images with Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids, Multiclass Classification using a visual vocabulary (Based on Bag Of Words) and both K-NN and SVM algorithms, Image stitching (Panorama), Multiclass Classification using both pre-trained and untrained convolutional neural networks, Geometric transformations on Images, Image feature descriptor extraction and related algorithms (feature detection - SIFT, SURF, etc). All of these algorithms are applied
from scratch in python.
