# Computer Vision, Image Processing and Analysis

* Study of image processing algorithms (noise reduction, filtering, compression, improvement, edge detection)
* Proccessing of images with Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids
* Multiclass Classification using a visual vocabulary (Based on Bag Of Words) and both K-NN and SVM algorithms, Multiclass Classification using both pre-trained and untrained convolutional neural networks,
* Image stitching (Panorama) 
* Geometric transformations on Images, Image feature descriptor extraction and related algorithms (feature detection - SIFT, SURF, etc). 

<br /> All of these algorithms are applied
from scratch in python.
